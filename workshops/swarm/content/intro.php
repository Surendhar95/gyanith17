<p>Swarm robotics is a field of multi-robotics in which 
large number of robots is coordinated in a distributed
 and decentralized fashion. This project features Swarm-bot
 capable of being used as a transportation bot. Swarm-bots
 uses the concept of master and slave technique whereby 
 the master controls the slave using RF module to carry 
 out a desired task. The main objective of the Swarm-bots
 project is to study and aim at controlling slave bots 
 (A.K.A: S-Bots) which would be physically interconnected. <br><br>
The <b>robots</b> in the <b>swarm</b> should have some basic functions-<br>
<ol>
<li><b>Inter-Communication:</b> The Robots in the swarm exchange
 information amongst them which spreads through the whole swarm through
 autonomous behaviours. This results in the swarm-level cooperation.</li>
<li>No collision between swarm robots</li>
<li> Synchronization between bots</li>
</ol>
