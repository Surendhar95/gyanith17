Remember when you were young and waved at the aircrafts flying high above? Well its time make your own and fly one!<br><br>
In this workshop, you will be thought to make an RC (Remote controlled) aircraft from scratch. First participants will be taught about the basics of an aircraft and aerodynamics followed by a hands on experience on their RC plane kit. At the end of the workshop the aircraft made by the students will take on a flight test, flown by volunteers themselves.
