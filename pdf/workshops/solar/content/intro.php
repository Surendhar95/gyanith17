<p>
The participants will be guided through simulation 
of solar panel and dc motor. They will be provided
 with a kit and will have hands-on experience with 
 simulation in MATLAB and its hardware implementation 
 of solar fed motor.  By the end of the workshop 
 participants will have a complete idea on solar power
 generation , DC motor modelling and MATLAB simulation.
 (Participants are requested to bring their own laptops
 preferably with MATLAB installed.)<br><br>
<b>* Note</b> - A takeaway kit ( consisting of solar panel, voltage regulator circuit and DC motor) worth of Rs. 1500 will be provided to each team.
