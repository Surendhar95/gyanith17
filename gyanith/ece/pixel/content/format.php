<p>
The event will be conducted in 3 rounds .<br/>
•	Round 1<br/>
o	The bots have to first recognize the number of contour for a specific shape present in the initial frame at the starting point.<br/>
o	The number of contours present in the image will correspond to a particular color line which the bots have to sense and follow.<br/>
o	Once the color is identified the bot has to take a 180 degree turn and start following the path with the identified color.<br/>
o	And subsequent paths have to be chosen according to the number of contours present at the end of the track of a particular track and should reach the destination.<br/>
o	One half of the number of participants will be selected for the second round ,the winner will be classified based on the time of completion of the track(Shortest will be selected first).<br/>


•	Round 2<br/>

o	Basic sensing is same as round 1.<br/>
o	In this round ,the participants will be allowed to compete simultaneously ,each participant can chose the color that their bot is going to follow.<br/>
o	In this round the bots will encounter multiple paths with the same color ,but it has to follow the path where the bots won’t be crossing each other . If encountered with a crossing ,the bot has to retrace its path to choose another appropriate path.<br/>
o	The bot which completes and reaches its destination will be the winner for that round and half the number of participants in round 2 will be selected for round 3.<br/>

•	Round 3<br/>

It will be an on spot competition which will be based on similar concepts.
