Think that you are a good skit actor haa! Here’s the chance to prove you’re good at acting and cracking it. Sign in for SPECULATE and prove your acting skills to recognize the circuit name and design it first. It’s like Dumb charades. A circuit name will be given to one of the team member and he/she has to enact and convey the name to others in the team without speaking, design it and crack the output. There will only be one round and each team will have 3 members. It’s like fastest finger first. Guess the circuit, design it, crack the output first and win the prize.
