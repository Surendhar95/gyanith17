 then look no further, because we have got just the right event for you. In this event 
 your skills for identifying circuits and diffusing circuits will be tested. Each team 
 consists of three members who will have to go through 2 rounds. First round for identifying circuits and 
the second round for creating an alarm bomb and diffusing it.
